ObjectDescription
=================

This project uses the OpenCV library to detect objects in an image file, the algorithm runs on self learning mechanism. Using the supervision technique of Artificial algorithm we can make this algorithm learn through the shapes and later our algorithm can give up to 80% of positive results on test data.
